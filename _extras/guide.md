## Overview

Why do we study gene expression as a quantitative trait?
  *   Because the road from genotype to phenotype runs through gene expression
  *   Because we know a lot about simple phenotypes and their causes, but very
        little of the genetic basis of complex and quantitative traits including most
        common diseases
        
The Problem
  *   Complex and quantitative traits are poorly defined. We don't know:
      *   the number of loci underlying variation in heritable phenotypes
      *   the distribution of effect sizes
      *   the mechanism of action or interaction
      *   how the environment influences quantitative traits
        
Expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis
  *   Genome-wide gene expression is heritable in most organisms
  *   Insight into heritability, effect sizes, mechanisms, and environmental influences
  *   can be studied in fields of biomedicine, agriculture and evolutionary biology 
  *   same approach as with phenotypes like cholesterol, plant yield or bird egg size 
  *   Abundance of transcript is a quantitative trait like these others
  *   can be described with linkage and association mapping like these others

## Introduction

*   Genome variability influences disease risk
    * our task - identify effects of genome variants to understand disease biology 
      or organismal phenotype
      
*   Simple Mendelian traits demonstrate direct route from geno to expression to pheno 
    * CF involves variants of a single gene that result in misshapen Cl+ channel protein
    
*   Complex & quantitative traits not so directly understood
    * includes common human diseases - asthma, Alzheimer's, most cancers & others
    * complex interplay between not one but many genes & the environment
    * GWAS associate genetic variants with complex traits, but most variants located in
      non-coding regions
    * likely involved in gene regulation, which controls quantity, timing &
      locale of gene expression 
      
*   eQTL analysis studies effects of genetic variants on cell or tissue gene expression
    * eQTL is locus associated with expression of gene(s)
    * explains some of variation in gene expression
    
* The promise
    * reveal architecture of quant traits
    * connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation
    * shed light on transcriptional regulation & regulatory variation
    * traditional linkage & association mapping applied to thousand of GE transcripts
    * much like mapping physiological phenotypes like cholesterol or blood pressure
    * combine GE and physiological phenos with genetic variation to find genes 
    affecting disease phenos
    
* we'll look at an eQTL study of type-2 diabetes-associated traits in DO mice as example
