## Overview

*   Why do we study gene expression as a quantitative trait?
    *   Because the road from genotype to phenotype runs through gene expression
    *   Because we know a lot about simple phenotypes and their causes, but very
        little of the genetic basis of complex and quantitative traits including most
        common diseases
        
*   The Problem
    *   Complex and quantitative traits are poorly defined
        *   we don't know the number of loci underlying variation in heritable phenotypes
        *   we don't know the distribution of effect sizes
        *   we don't know the mechanism of action or interaction
        *   we don't understand how the environment influences quantitative traits
        
*   Expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis
    *   Genome-wide gene expression is heritable in most organisms
    *   Insight into heritability, effect sizes, mechanisms, and environmental influences 
        can be studied in biomedicine, agriculture and evolutionary biology in the same
        way that phenotypes like cholesterol, plant yield or songbird egg size can be
        studied
    *   Abundance of a transcript is a quantitative trait like these others, and can be
        described with linkage and association mapping like these others

## Introduction

*   Genome variability influences disease risk
    * our task - identify effects of genome variants to understand disease biology 
      or organismal phenotype
      
*   Simple Mendelian traits demonstrate direct route from geno to expression to pheno 
    * CF involves variants of a single gene that result in misshapen Cl+ channel protein
    
*   Complex & quantitative traits not so directly understood
    * includes common human diseases - asthma, Alzheimer's, most cancers & others
    * complex interplay between not one but many genes & the environment
    * GWAS associate genetic variants with complex traits, but most variants located in
      non-coding regions
    * likely involved in gene regulation, which controls quantity, timing &
      locale of gene expression 
      
*   Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis studies effects of genetic 
    variants on cell or tissue gene expression
