## Overview

Why do we study gene expression as a quantitative trait?
  *   Because the road from genotype to phenotype runs through gene expression
  *   Because we know a lot about simple phenotypes and their causes, but very
        little of the genetic basis of complex and quantitative traits including most
        common diseases
        
The Problem
  *   Complex and quantitative traits are poorly defined. We don't know:
      *   the number of loci underlying variation in heritable phenotypes
      *   the distribution of effect sizes
      *   the mechanism of action or interaction
      *   how the environment influences quantitative traits
        
Expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis
  *   Genome-wide gene expression is heritable in most organisms
  *   Insight into heritability, effect sizes, mechanisms, and environmental influences
  *   can be studied in fields of biomedicine, agriculture and evolutionary biology 
  *   same approach as with phenotypes like cholesterol, plant yield or bird egg size 
  *   Abundance of transcript is a quantitative trait like these others
  *   can be described with linkage and association mapping like these others

## Introduction

Genome variability influences disease risk
   * our task - identify effects of genome variants to understand disease biology 
      or organismal phenotype
      
Simple Mendelian traits demonstrate direct route from geno to expression to pheno 
   * CF involves variants of a single gene that result in misshapen Cl+ channel protein
    
Complex & quantitative traits not so directly understood
  * includes common human diseases - asthma, Alzheimer's, most cancers & others
  * complex interplay between not one but many genes & the environment
  * GWAS associate genetic variants with complex traits, but most variants located in
      non-coding regions
  * likely involved in gene regulation, which controls quantity, timing &
      locale of gene expression 
      
eQTL analysis studies effects of genetic variants on cell or tissue gene expression
  * eQTL is locus associated with expression of gene(s)
  * explains some of variation in gene expression
    
The promise
   * reveal architecture of quant traits
   * connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation
   * shed light on transcriptional regulation & regulatory variation
   * traditional linkage & association mapping applied to thousand of GE transcripts
   * much like mapping physiological phenotypes like cholesterol or blood pressure
   * combine GE and physiological phenos with genetic variation to find genes 
  affecting disease phenos
    
We'll look at an eQTL study of type-2 diabetes-associated traits in DO mice as example

## Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function

T2D is a complex disease influenced by many genes interacting with the environment
  * environment changed drastically as we moved away from farming into factories
  * Industrial agriculture drives a food pipeline of soft drinks, burgers & cheap foods
  * U.S. farms produce 3900 cals per citizen, twice what we need and up 700 cals from 1980
  * Food industry found a way to get extra calories into us even if we didn't want them
    * Larger packaging, supersizing - we are willing subjects in this experiment
  * Prevalence of T2D has expanded rapidly as has obesity
  
Susceptibility to T2D increases with obesity such that T2D loci operate mainly under obesity
  * Most of 100 loci associated with T2D affect pancreatic islet function
  * produce insulin for regulating blood glucose
  * like most GWAS loci, T2D loci have very small effect sizes and odds ratios ~ 1
  
Genetic Drivers studied islet gene expression
  * hypothesis: gene expression changes in response to dietary challenge would reveal
    signaling pathways involved in stress responses
  * expression of many genes often map to same locus, so genes are regulated in common
  * if their mRNAs encode proteins with common functions, function of driver gene revealed
  * variation in expression of driver gene, rather than genetic variant, is immediate
    cause of disease-related pheno
    
DO mice on high-fat high-sugar diet as stressor sensitizing them to develop diabetic traits
  * body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride
  * glucose tolerance test with measure of dynamic glucose and insulin changes over time
  * area under curve for glucose and insulin
  * Islet cells isolated from pancreas for RNA extraction & GE measurements
