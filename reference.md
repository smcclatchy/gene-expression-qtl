## Glossary

association mapping
:   scanning the genome for significant associations between genetic markers (e.g. SNPs)
    and phenotypes to identify functional genetic variants (e.g. loci or alleles)
linkage disequilibrium
:   frequency of association between loci is non-random and is higher or lower than 
    would be expected if they were independent and randomly associated; alleles tend
    to co-segregate and be inherited together in LD   
linkage mapping
:   determining the position of genes or genetic markers relative to one another on the 
    same chromosome by the recombination frequency between them
