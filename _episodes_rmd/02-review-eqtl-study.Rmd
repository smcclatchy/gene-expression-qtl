Most of the more than 100 genetic loci associated with type II diabetes affect 
the function of pancreatic islets, which produce insulin for regulating blood
glucose levels. Susceptibility to type II diabetes (T2D) increases with obesity, 
such that T2D-associated genetic loci operate primarily under conditions of 
obesity. (See [Keller, Mark P et al. “Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function.” Genetics vol. 209,1 (2018): 335-356](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937189/).)
