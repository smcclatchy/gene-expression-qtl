title: "Mediation Analysis"
teaching: 10
exercises: 2
questions:
- "What is mediation analysis?"
- "How is mediation analysis used in genetics and genomics?"
- "How do I explore causal relations with mediation analysis?"
objectives:
- "Describe mediation analysis as applied in genetics and genomics."
keypoints:
- "Mediation analysis investigates an intermediary between an independent variable and its effect on a dependent variable."
- "Mediation analysis is used in high-throughput genomics studies to identify molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression or methylation traits, that mediate the effect of genetic variation on disease phenotypes or other outcomes of interest."

GWAS studies show that most disease-associated variants are found in non-coding
regions. This fact leads to the idea that regulation of gene expression is an
important mechanism enabling genetic variants to affect complex traits. 
Mediation analysis can identify a causal chain from genetic variants to 
molecular and clinical phenotypes. It is widely used in the social sciences 
including psychology. In biomedicine, mediation analysis has been employed to
investigate how gene expression mediates the effects of genetic variants on 
complex phenotypes and disease.

Below, a genetic variant (non-coding SNP) indirectly regulates expression of 
gene 2 through a mediator, gene 1. The SNP regulates expression of gene 1 in 
cis, and expression of gene 1 influences expression of gene 2 in trans.

![Chromosome 13 gene Akr1e1 is affected by expression in both cis and trans by genes on chromosomes 13 and 4.](../fig/LOD-plot-Akr1e1.png)

![Chromosome 11 gene Myo15b is affected by expression of a trans gene in the chromosome 2 hotspot.](../fig/LOD-plot-Myo15b.png)

![Mediating expression of Myo15b identifies Hnf4a as the gene that drops the LOD score from greater than 70 to less than 50.](../fig/mediation-Hnf4a-Myo15b.png)
