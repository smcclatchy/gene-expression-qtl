Genome variability has relevance for differential disease risk among individuals. Determining the specific biological effects of genome variants on cells is key to understanding disease biology or organismal phenotype. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that most of these variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome and are therefore likely to be involved in gene regulation. Analyzing these variants in the context of cellular or tissue gene expression is known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. eQTL analysis can reveal the architecture of quantitative traits, connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation, and shed light on transcriptional regulation and regulatory variation. Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and association mapping can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts) in eQTL analysis. An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) explains part of the variation in gene expression. Specifically, genetic variants underlying eQTL explain variation in gene expression levels.

In this lesson, we will revisit genetic mapping and apply it to gene expression. The examples we use will come from [Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.300864) by Keller, et al.
