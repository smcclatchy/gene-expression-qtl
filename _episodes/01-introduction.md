Genome variability influences differential disease risk among individuals. Identifying the
effects of genome variants is key to understanding disease biology or organismal 
phenotype. The effects of variants in many single-gene disorders, such as cystic
fibrosis, are generally well-characterized and their disease biology well understood. 
Mutations in the coding region of the CFTR gene alters the three-dimensional structure of 
resulting chloride channel proteins in epithelial cells, affecting not only chloride 
transport but also sodium and potassium transport in the lungs, pancreas and skin. The
most common human disorders, however, involve many genes and are not well understood. 
Cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes and cancer involve many 
genes interacting with the environment and with one another, a far more complicated path 
to follow than the path from a single gene mutation to its resulting protein and 
ultimately to a disease phenotype. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate 
that most variants in common diseases are located in non-coding regions of the genome and 
are therefore likely to be involved in gene regulation.

Analyzing genome variants through cell or tissue gene expression is known as expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. An eQTL explains part of the variation in gene 
expression. Specifically, genetic variants underlying eQTL explain variation in gene 
expression levels. eQTL analysis can reveal the architecture of quantitative traits, 
connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation, and shed light on transcriptional 
regulation and regulatory variation. Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and 
association mapping can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts) in 
eQTL analysis, such that gene expression can be mapped in much the same way as a 
physiological phenotype like blood pressure or heart rate. Joining gene expression and 
physiological phenotypes with genetic variation can uncover genes with variants affecting 
disease-associated phenotypes. 

In this lesson we revisit genetic mapping and apply it to gene expression. The examples 
come from 
[Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.300864)
by Keller, et al. This study offers supporting evidence for type 2 diabetes-associated 
loci in human GWAS, most of which affect pancreatic islet function. The study assessed 
pancreatic islet gene expression in Diversity Outbred mice on either a regular chow
or high-fat high-sugar diet. Islet mRNA abundance was quantified and
analyzed, and the study identified more than 18,000 eQTL.
