questions:
- "What are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)?"
- "How are eQTL used in genetic studies?"
objectives:
- "Describe how an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) impacts gene expression."
- "Describe how eQTL are used in genetic studies."
keypoints:
- "An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) explains part of the variation in gene expression."
- "Traditional linkage and association mapping can be applied to gene expression traits (transcripts)."
- "Genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that underlie eQTL illuminate transcriptional regulation and variation.

- Genetic analysis of gene expression can reveal the architecture of quantitative traits, connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation, and shed light on transcriptional regulation and regulatory variation. 

- Gene expression in numerous species shows abundant heritable variation among individuals and strains. 

- Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and association mapping can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts). 

- An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) explains part of the variation in gene expression. Specifically, genetic variants underlying eQTL explain variation in gene expression levels.
