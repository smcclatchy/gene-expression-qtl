Genome variability influences differential disease risk among individuals. 
Identifying the effects of genome variants is key to understanding disease 
biology or organismal phenotype. The effects of variants in many single-gene 
disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, are generally well-characterized and their 
disease biology well understood. In cystic fibrosis for example, mutations in 
the coding region of the CFTR gene alters the three-dimensional structure of 
resulting chloride channel proteins in epithelial cells, affecting not only 
chloride transport but also sodium and potassium transport in the lungs, 
pancreas and skin. The path from gene mutation to altered protein to disease 
phenotype is relatively simple and well understood. The most common human 
disorders, however, involve many genes interacting with the environment and with 
one another, a far more complicated path to follow than the path from a single 
gene mutation to its resulting protein to a disease phenotype. Cardiovascular 
disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes and cancer involve a 
complex interplay of genes with environment, and their mechanisms are not well 
understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) associate genetic loci with disease
traits, yet most GWAS variants for common diseases like diabetes are located in non-coding 
regions of the genome. These variants are therefore likely to be involved in gene 
regulation. 

![GWAS variants such as SNPs are often in non-coding regions of the genome, indicating that they regulate gene expression. Here a non-coding SNP influences expression of a gene, which in turn affects a disease phenotype or other outcome of interest.](../fig/cis-regulation-single-gene.png)

Gene regulation controls the quantity, timing and locale of gene expression. 
Analyzing genome variants through cell or tissue gene expression is known as 
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. An eQTL is a locus associated with
expression of a gene or genes. An eQTL explains some of the variation in gene expression. 
Specifically, genetic variants underlying eQTL explain variation in gene expression 
levels. eQTL studies can reveal the architecture of quantitative traits, connect DNA 
sequence variation to phenotypic variation, and shed light on transcriptional regulation 
and regulatory variation. Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and 
association mapping can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits 
(transcripts) in eQTL analysis, such that gene expression can be mapped in much 
the same way as a physiological phenotype like blood pressure or heart rate. 
Joining gene expression and physiological phenotypes with genetic variation can 
uncover genes with variants affecting disease phenotypes.

To the simple diagram above we'll add two more details. Non-coding SNPs can 
regulate gene expression from nearby on the same chromosome (in cis):

![Genetic variants like SNPs often affect gene expression locally near the gene that they regulate (in cis).](../fig/cis-regulation-gene1.png)

SNPs that affect gene expression from afar, often from a different chromosome 
from the gene that they regulate are called trans regulators.

![Alternatively, SNPs often affect gene expression distally from the gene that they regulate (in trans), often from a different chromosome altogether.](../fig/trans-regulation-gene2.png)

In this lesson we revisit genetic mapping and apply it to gene expression. The 
examples are from 
[Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.300864)
by Keller, et al. This study offers supporting evidence for type 2 
diabetes-associated loci in human GWAS, most of which affect pancreatic islet 
function. The study assessed pancreatic islet gene expression in Diversity 
Outbred mice on either a regular chow or high-fat high-sugar diet. Islet mRNA 
abundance was quantified and analyzed, and the study identified more than 18,000 
eQTL.
