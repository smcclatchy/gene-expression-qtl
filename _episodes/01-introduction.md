Genetic analysis of gene expression can reveal the architecture of quantitative traits, connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation, and shed light on transcriptional regulation and regulatory variation. Gene expression in numerous species shows abundant heritable variation among individuals and strains. Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and association mapping can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts). An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) explains a fraction of the genetic variance of a gene expression phenotype.
