Genome variability has relevance for differential disease risk among individuals. Determining the specific biological effects of genome variants on cells is key to understanding disease biology or organismal phenotype. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that most of these variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome and are therefore likely to be involved in gene regulation. Analyzing these variants in the context of cellular or tissue gene expression is known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. eQTL analysis can reveal the architecture of quantitative traits, connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation, and shed light on transcriptional regulation and regulatory variation. Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and association mapping can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts) in eQTL analysis, such that gene expression can be mapped in much the same way as a physiological phenotype like blood pressure or heart rate. An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) explains part of the variation in gene expression. Specifically, genetic variants underlying eQTL explain variation in gene expression levels.

Connecting gene expression and other phenotypes to genetic variation can reveal genes with variants that affect disease-associated phenotypes. Often many gene expression traits will map to the same locus and are influenced by common gene variant. When these comapping mRNAs encode proteins that are associated with common physiological functions this can shed light on potential biological functions of the driver gene(s). These connections evoke testable hypotheses whereby variation in the expression of a driver gene, rather than a genetic variant, can be established as a more proximal cause for a disease-related phenotype.


In this lesson, we will revisit genetic mapping and apply it to gene expression. The examples we use will come from [Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.300864) by Keller, et al. This study offers supporting evidence for type 2 diabetes-associated loci in human GWAS. Most type 2 diabetes-associated loci affect pancreatic islet function. The study assessed pancreatic islet gene expression in Diversity Outbred mice on either a regular chow or high-fat high-sugar diet. Islet mRNA abundance was quantified and analyzed. The study identified more than 18,000 eQTL.
