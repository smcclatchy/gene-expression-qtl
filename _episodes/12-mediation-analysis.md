title: "Mediation Analysis"
teaching: 10
exercises: 2
questions:
- "What is mediation analysis?"
- "How is mediation analysis used in genetics and genomics?"
- "How do I explore causal relations with mediation analysis?"
objectives:
- "Describe mediation analysis as applied in genetics and genomics."
keypoints:
- "Mediation analysis investigates an intermediary between an independent variable and its effect on a dependent variable."
- "Mediation analysis is used in high-throughput genomics studies to identify molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression or methylation traits, that mediate the effect of genetic variation on disease phenotypes or other outcomes of interest."
