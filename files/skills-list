Skills List

background knowledge and skills include
•	Knowledge of genetics
•	QTL mapping basics in qtl2 (at least knowing how to map QTLs in DO mice)
•	R skills (at least basic knowledge)
•	Background in statistics (?) to understand the different analysis types in r/qtl2
•	Information about rna-seq and expression data (or has data available but want to see what type of information can be drawn from it)

After the training, participants will:
•	recognize that traditional linkage and association analysis techniques can be applied to transcripts 
•	
•	map expression traits and interpret the results
•	Different conclusions that can been drawn from the analysis and how to take it forward

an (incomplete) list of target skills include:

o	Control file with all necessary information about files and codes
o	Know what information is necessary
o	Phenotypes
o	calculate a Kinship matrix
o	calculate genoprobs
•	map expression traits to DO mice
