Study Hypothesis/what is eQTL mapping? - answered in 01-introduction.md
Where We Are Going - describe Attie experiment, hypothesis, study design & key results
Data Preparation (or have data ready) What do we need? - revisit smcclatchy.github.io/mapping for these steps
QTL analysis (and what does it mean?) The same as before? - compare/contrast QTL with eQTL
Mediation Analysis â€“ What is it? What does it do?
Result Interpretation (Sue Example) - now do some of this yourself


1. introduce eqtl mapping - what is it, why is it used?
2. introduce Attie data and describe Attie experiment, hypothesis, study design & key results
3. explore data - summarized data, matrices w/sample annotation, exp data, gene annotation, like bioconductor summarized experiment etc = whole set of rectangles
4. look at distribution of data and transformation to rankZ
5. review mapping steps w/ one simple pheno - choose wisely to get a nice peak; insulin AUC, chr 11, Hnf1b
6. map 1 gene expression trait - Hnf1b
7. map enough genes so that you can look at a table (50-100?)
8. need some other kind of summary - transcriptome map
9. max qtl on x-axis, gene pos on y
10. provide script and data to run, LOD object = 120000markers by 20k genes - find peaks; do not run in class
11. make real transcriptome map - cis vs trans qtl - gene regulation, big vs. small LODs; trans bands - transcription factors
12. mediation analysis and causal models
  Akr1e1 chr13 local qtl LOD 17 distal qtl LOD 110
  run mediation on islet RNA
  attie data eqtl viewer

  Myo15b chr2 qtl decent lod drop Hnf4a (hotspot)
  pull example out of hotspot that points back
  in this case chr2 hotspot points to Hnf4a
 
 suggestions for next time:
 Belinda
  simplify code for all steps
  don't touch interpreting the results 
 participants
  include mediation analysis
  make two days
 Dan
  simplify loading & exploring data
  follow a single phenotype, not all
  keep log transform expression data
  go through reviewing mapping steps more quickly (qtl2 is a prereq)
  don't reteach it - give people an exercise in which they do qtl mapping collectively
  Sue creates an exercise to place at the top of that episode
  episode 5 - help people understand that eqtl are just another phenotype, but they have a genomic location so put a graphic here
  transcriptome map - instead of ggtmap, use tidyverse
  eqtl density plot was tricky for students to do themselves
  mapping 20k genes comes out of nowhere
